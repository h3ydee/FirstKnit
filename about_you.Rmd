# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
  I attended Palmdale High School and graduated in 2022. I think I'm more proficient in English and English is much easier for me than math. I was apart of the med academy in high school and I think did my best in the medical terminology class.

     


## Your computer and your and its capability?  
 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and out) How do you rate yourself?  You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer   
The computer I use is a Microsoft Surface 5 (windows). On a scale from 1 to 10 I would rate myself a 6 in my computer skills. I'm not super knowledgeable but I can figure out most problems and settings. My internet connection at home is pretty solid and reliable. It can be spotty at times but that's rare.  
   

## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be?
